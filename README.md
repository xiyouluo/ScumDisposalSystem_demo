# Scumbag-Disposal-System_Beta

## Project Overview

This project is a narrative-driven game demo, created in the Spring of 2023. The game features a dynamic storyline that evolves based on player choices, leading to multiple branching paths and different endings, and includes several embedded mini-games to enhance its playability and engagement.

## Important Notes

- **Qt Version**: This project uses **Qt 6.5**. In addition, you will need to include the Qt **Multimedia** library to handle background music (BGM) and other multimedia features.

   - **Image Generation**: Created the primary background images and character models for the game. Each image was meticulously selected. Also hand-drew the background for the game’s start screen.
